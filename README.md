## Description
The purpose of this repo, and this project, is to convert a fully functional Google Books API based search engine that is built with RESTful API, with a GraphQL API based application built with Apollo Server.

## Installation
If you want to run locally, run these commands from the root:

```bash
mongodb
npm run build
npm run develop
```

NOTE: Be aware you will need MongoDB to run locally. Use .env.EXAMPLE at server root to configure for yourself. 

And finally, below is a screenshot from within the application after registering a user, and logging some books.
